    We are a distributed team, with members based across the UK (and sometimes
    beyond). The vast majority of our activities are designed for a hybrid
    working model.
</p>

<p>
    Each year, there are several occasions where more of us tend to come
    together in person (which gives us the chance to take the photos you see
    here!):
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Away Days, where we brainstorm ways of improving what we do as a team;
    </li>

        AIUK, the Turing's <a href="https://ai-uk.turing.ac.uk/" target="_blank"
            >flagship conference</a
        >;
    </li>
    <li>
        Hack Week, where we take a week off work to create fun (and sometimes
        useful!) projects;
    </li>
    <li>
        RSECon, the annual <a

            target="_blank">conference for research software engineering</a
        >.

            We published a blog post about our experiences at Hack Week this
            year, and all the projects we worked on! (Yes, including dinosaurs.
            ðŸ¦–)

            For a more detailed look at how we work, do check out our handbook:

            processes.

    Apart from project work, we also have 20% of our time set aside for personal
    development as well as internal team responsibilities. Some of our outputs
    from this time include:
